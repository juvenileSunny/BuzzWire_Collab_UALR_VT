## Buzzwire Experiment

The core of this study revolves around a VR adaptation of the buzz-wire game, a tool used to measure precision, spatial awareness, and motor control. The game requires participants to navigate a loop along a virtual wire without making contact, with variations in hand orientation and head rotation to challenge different aspects of motor skills.
